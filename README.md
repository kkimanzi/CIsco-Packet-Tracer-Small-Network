# CIsco-Packet-Tracer-Small-Network
**Aim**
The aim of this project is to design, simulate and test a network. Cisco Packet Tracer shall be software used to simulate and test the network.

**Requirements**
The network is supposed to have the following requirements:
•	The network is expected to use a hierarchical model
•	The network should be connected to at least two ISPs for redundancy
•	The company network is connected to the static public IP addresses: 78.142.100.0/30, 78.142.100.4/30, 78.142.100.8/30, and 78.142.100.12/30.
•	The base network is supposed to have an IP address of 192.168.100.0
•	Each department should be in a different subnet and different VLAN
•	Each department should provide access to wireless networks for its users
•	IP addresses should be allocated dynamically using DHCP
•	Server room devices are to be allocated IP addresses statically
•	OSPF routing should be configured on the routers and layer 3 switches
•	Users in different departments should be able to communicate with each other using the multilayer switches configured for inter-VLAN routing
•	NAT should be configured to use the relevant IPv4 router address. Necessary ACL rules should also be configured. 
Besides these, the following basic configurations should be enabled:
•	The hostname should be configured for the core routers
•	The message of the day banner should be configured
•	Console and vty passwords should be configured
•	Password encryption services should be enabled
•	Users should be able to remotely access the network using SSH
